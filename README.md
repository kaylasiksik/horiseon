  Module 1 Horiseon Accessibility Challenge


## About

> The Horiseon website has been updated during this project.

> The purpose of the present project was to reconfigure a ficticious company's website in order to make it more accessible to those using screen reader features. 

> The HTML code has been updated to change the website's tite and heading attributes, to include semantic elements and alt attributes for accessibility purposes, and to fix other issues such as links that were not functional. 

> The CSS code has been updated to make the flow of the code more intuive for other developers making modifications to the website in the future such that it now follows the semantic structure of the corressponding HTML code.
